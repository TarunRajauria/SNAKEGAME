# Snake Game

A classic Snake Game implemented using Python's `turtle` module. This project is a fun and interactive way to understand basic game development concepts in Python.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.
- **Food Consumption**: The snake grows in length when it eats the food.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score and high score.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Run the Game**: Execute the Python script to start the game.
3. **Controls**:
   - `W`: Move Up
   - `A`: Move Left
   - `S`: Move Down
   - `D`: Move Right
4. **Objective**: Eat the red food to grow the snake and increase your score. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
